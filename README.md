# Genetic-Algorithm-Minimization

## What is a genetic algorithm?

A genetic algorithm is an optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics, which can be used to solve problems that a traditional iterative process may be inefficient.

Consider the scenario where we want to search for a solution in a given search space. We could construct a search tree, however a tree is seen as a combinatorial explosion, where the number of nodes to search increases exponetinally with the number of layers, with a time complexity of O(b^d) where b is the average branching factor, and d is the depth of the tree. This obviously becomes very computationally expensive so we use genetic algorithms, or more generally evolutionary algoriths.

## Brief walkthrough

 1) Representation encoding
    - We need to find a way of representing solutions in the search space such that we can perform these genetic operations
    - In general, we call the solutions chromosomes, and the indvidual values genes
    - Bitstrings for optimisations, or permuation encoding for shortest path problems

 2) Parent selection
    - Selecting two parents, so that we can create two offspring by combining the parents
    - Exploits survival of the fittest, by selecting the fittest parents from some selection 
    - Tournament selection or roulette wheel selection
 
 3) Crossover
    - Combining the genetic material of two parents to create two offspring
    - Different ways of doing this, such as one point crossover or uniform crossover

 4) Mutation
    - Randomly changing individual bits or genes in a given solution, so that we don't prematurely converge 


## How does the code work

Genrally the code written works in the same way. I used bitstings to represent the solutions, this is so when applying crossover or mutation, we can manipulate the solution with the bits or genes individually. For parent selection I used tournament selection, which means that we select the best of n randomly selected parents in the tournment. For crossover I used uniform crossover, which is modifiying the solutions bit by bit using a crossover template, where 0 means swap the two bits, and 1 means keep them the same. 

This process is continued over 1000 generations and the program will converge on a good set of values, where at the end, the fittest one is returend.

### Example

Let's say we want to minimise a function f(x) = 18.9829 - x * sin(âˆš|x|)

Where this function looks like the below:
